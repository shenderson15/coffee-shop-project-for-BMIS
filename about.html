                <p class="about-text">Founded by Sophie Henderson as part of her Hogan Entrepreneurial Leadership Program project at Gonzaga University, The Study Spot was created with a vision to offer a welcoming space for students and the Spokane community. What started as a simple coffee shop has now grown into a favorite destination for Gonzaga, Whitworth, Eastern, SCC, and WSU students, as well as locals who enjoy artisan coffee and delicious snacks.</p>
